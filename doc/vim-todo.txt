INTRODUCTION                                          *vim-todo*

Simple todo list that gathers occurences of alarm words (TODO, FIXME) from
files recursively contained in the current directory and displays these in a
buffer.

You can then review them and go to the original file and line by hitting <CR>.


INSTALLATION                                          *vim-todo-installation*

vim-todo requires |ruby| support, |vim-layout| and assumes a |pathogen| style
setup where both vim-layout and vim-todo are subdirectories of your runtimepath.

*vim-layout* http://github.com/svenfuchs/vim-layout
*pathogen*   http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen


USAGE                                                 *vim-todo-usage*

This will open the todo window:

  :todo

Just navigate around and type <CR> to open the file under the cursor.
